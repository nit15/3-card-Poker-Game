How the game is played: 


***Keep in mind: there are different variations of this game you will 
find on the web; the following is how your version will play***
In three card poker, each player only plays against the dealers hand,

not each other:
• Both players will start by placing an ante wager. We will limit the ante bet to $5 or 
greater, up to $25. 
• There is one optional bet the players can make called the Pair Plus wager. We will 
also limit this bet to $5 or greater, up to $25. This is a separate bet that will win if a 
players hand is at least a pair of 2’s. The payoff for this bet applies regardless of the 
dealers hand and what happens in the rest of the game. (See below for payouts). 
• After all bets are made(ante and/or pair plus), the cards are dealt out. Each player 
and the dealer receive three cards each. The players cards are face up and the 
dealers hand is face down.
• Each player must decide if they will play or fold. If they fold, they lose their ante wager 
and pair plus wager(if they made one). 
• If the player wants to continue, they will make a play wager (this must be equal to the 
amount of the ante wager).
• At this point, the dealer will show their cards. If the dealer does not have at least a 
Queen high or better, the play wager is returned to the players who did not fold and 
the ante bet is pushed to the next hand.
• If the dealer does have at least a Queen high or better, then each players hand, that 
did not fold, is evaluated against the dealers hand (see below for order of winning 
hands). If the dealer wins, the player loses both the ante and play wager. If the player 
wins, they get paid out 1 to 1 (they get back double what they wagered). Say the 
player bet $5 each for the ante and play wager and won, they would get back $20.






For the Pair Plus wager:


As long as the player does not fold, the Pair Plus wager gets evaluated regardless of if 
their hand beat the dealers hand; it is a separate bet based solely on the players hand. 
If the player does not have at least a pair of 2’s, they lose this bet. Otherwise, the 
payouts are as follows:
• Straight Flush 40 to 1
• Three of a Kind 30 to 1
• Straight 6 to 1
• Flush 3 to 1
• Pair 1 to 1
